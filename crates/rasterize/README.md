### Overview about Rasterization

Rasterization in graphics refers to the process of converting vector-based images or geometric shapes into a pixel-based format suitable for display on digital screens or printing[1][3]. This fundamental technique in computer graphics involves several key steps:

1. The vector image or 3D model is divided into a grid of pixels.
2. For each pixel, the rasterizer determines which parts of the image or geometric primitives intersect with it.
3. The color and intensity of each pixel are calculated based on properties like color, texture, lighting, and transparency of the intersecting elements.
4. The resulting pixel information is used to create a raster image that can be displayed on screens or printed[1].

Rasterization is crucial in the rendering pipeline for several reasons:

1. It enables the creation of realistic and visually appealing images from vector graphics or 3D models.
2. It's essential for real-time graphics applications like video games and interactive simulations due to its computational efficiency.
3. It allows for the representation of complex shapes, textures, and shading effects that are difficult to achieve with vector-based graphics alone[1].

Rasterization is widely used in various fields, including graphic design, web development, computer-aided design (CAD), scientific visualization, and medical imaging[3]. It's particularly important in real-time rendering scenarios where speed and efficiency are critical, as it allows for the rapid conversion of complex 3D scenes into 2D images that can be displayed on screens[5][9].
